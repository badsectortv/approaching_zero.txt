Using nmap to test your system's potential weak points.

You may have heard horror stories about how easy it is for evil system
crackers to probe potential victims' systems for vulnerabilities using
software tools readily available on the Internet. The bad news is,
these stories are generally true. The good news is, many of these
tools are extremely useful (and even designed) for the legitimate
purpose of scanning your own system for weaknesses.

This and next month's column will explore some of the ways ordinary
system administrators and high-powered security professionals alike
can use nmap and nessus, two outstanding open-source packages, to
improve system security. But remember, knowledge is power, and it's up
to you to use it responsibly (and in ways that won't compel any men in
black to confiscate your beloved Red Hat boxen).

Why We (Good Guys) Scan

Why scan? If you're a system cracker, you scan to determine what
services a system is running and to which well-known vulnerabilities
those services appear to be subject. If you're a system administrator
you scan for essentially the same reasons but in the interest of
fixing (or at least understanding) your systems, not breaking into
them.

It may sound odd for good guys to use the same tools as the bad guys
they're trying to thwart.  After all, we don't test our door locks by
trying to kick in our own doors. But system security is exponentially
more complicated than physical security. It's nowhere near as easy to
gauge the relative security of a networked computer system as it is
the door to your house. While ideally we should always know which
network processes are active on every host we administer, the fact is
that in this age of hyper-connectedness it's difficult to keep track
of this information.

Therefore, we security-conscious geeks are obliged to take seriously
any tool that can provide some sort of sanity check, even an
incomplete and imperfect one (as is anything that tries to measure a
moving target like system security), despite or even because of that
tool's usefulness to the bad guys. However, we also need to remember
that neither a security scanner nor any other single tool or technique
will magically grant total security. Repeat after me: security is a
process, not a product.

Having said all that, there's one more reason we dig security
scanners: notoriety. It's fun to pretend to be a s00p3r 3L33T
HaX0r. Using tools like nmap and nessus while saying with a straight
face that we're ``working'' is priceless!

                 Types of Scans and Their Uses

There are basically two types of system scans. Port scans look for
open TCP and UDP ports, for ``listening services''. Security scans go
a step further and probe identified services for known weaknesses. In
terms of sophistication, doing a port scan is like counting how many
doors and windows a house has; running a security scan is more like
rattling all the doorknobs and checking the windows for alarm-sensors.

Oh, I almost forgot ping sweeps, arguably a third kind of scan. These
are done to identify which IPs in a given range or network are active
(i.e., which hosts respond to pinging). While this can be useful
depending on the task at hand, in the interests of keeping this
month's column to a manageable level, I'll focus on single-system port
and security scanning.  Everything we discuss here applies whether
you're scanning five hosts or 65,500.

                 nmap, World Champion Port-Scanner

The basic premise of port scanning is simple: if you try to connect to
a given port, you can determine whether that port is closed/inactive
or whether an application (i.e., web server, FTP d�mon, etc.) is
accepting connections there. As it happens, it is easy to write a
simple port-scanner that uses the local connect( ) system call to TCP
connections on various ports; with the right modules, you can even do
this with Perl. However, this method also happens to be the most
obtrusive and obvious way to scan, and it tends to result in numerous
log entries on one's target systems.

Enter nmap, by Fyodor. nmap can do simple connect( ) scans if you
like, but its real thing is ``stealth scanning''. Stealth scanning
involves the use of ersatz TCP packets designed to trigger a response
from each target system without actually completing a TCP connection.

nmap supports not one, but four different kinds of stealth scans in
addition to TCP Connect scanning, UDP scanning, RPC scanning, ping
sweeps and even operating system fingerprinting. It also boasts a
number of features more useful to black-hat than white-hat hackers,
such as FTP-bounce scanning, ACK scanning and Window firewall
scanning, but those are of little interest to Linux Journal's highly
ethical readers. In short, nmap is by far the most feature-rich and
versatile port-scanner available today.

Here, then, is a summary of the most important types of scans nmap can do: 

TCP Connect Scan--uses the OS's native connect( ) system call to
attempt a full three-way TCP handshake (SYN, ACK-SYN, ACK) on each
probed port. A failed connection (i.e., if the server replies to your
SYN packet with an ACK-RST packet) indicates a closed port. It doesn't
require root privileges and is one of the faster scanning methods. Not
surprisingly, however, most server applications will log connections
that are closed immediately after they're open, so this is a fairly
``noisy'' scan.

TCP SYN Scan--two-thirds of a TCP Connect scan; if the target returns
an ACK-SYN packet, nmap immediately sends an RST packet rather than
completing the handshake with an ACK packet. ``Half-open'' connections
such as these are far less likely to be logged, so SYN scanning is
much less perceptible than TCP Connect scanning. The trade-off is that
since nmap, rather than the kernel, builds these packets, you must be
root to run nmap in this mode.

TCP FIN Scan--rather than even pretending to initiate a standard TCP
connection, nmap sends a single FIN (final) packet. If the target's
TCP/IP stack is RFC-793-compliant (MS-anything, HP-UX, IRIX, MVS and
Cisco IOS are not) then open ports will drop the packet and closed
ports will send an RST.

TCP NULL Scan--similar to a FIN scan but instead a TCP-flagless packet
(i.e., a null packet) is sent. Also relies on the RFC-793-compliant
behavior described above.

TCP Xmas Tree Scan--similar to a FIN scan but instead sends a packet
with its FIN, PSH and URG flags (final, push data and urgent,
respectively) set. It also relies on the RFC-793-compliant behavior
described above.

UDP Scan--because UDP is a connectionless protocol, i.e., there's no
protocol-defined relationship between packets in either direction, UDP
has no handshake to play with as in the TCP scans described
above. However, most OS' TCP/IP stacks will return an ICMP ``Port
Unreachable'' packet if a UDP packet is sent to a closed UDP
port. Thus, a port that doesn't return an ICMP packet can be assumed
open. Since neither the probe-packet nor its potential ICMP packet are
guaranteed to arrive (remember, UDP is connectionless and so is ICMP)
nmap will typically send several UDP packets per UDP probed port to
reduce false positives. In my experience the accuracy of nmap's UDP
scanning varies among target OSes, but it's better than nothing.

RPC Scan--used in conjunction with other scan types, this feature will
cause nmap to attempt to determine which of the ports identified as
open are hosting RPC (remote procedure call) services, and what those
services and version numbers are.

Ping Scan (Sweep)--see ``Types of Scans and Their Uses'' above. 

Whew! Quite a list of scanning methods--and I've left out ACK scans
and Window scans (see the man page on nmap(1) if you're
interested). nmap has another very useful feature, OS
fingerprinting. Based on characteristics of a target's responses to
various arcane packets that nmap sends, nmap can make an educated
guess as to which operating system each target host is running.

                 Getting and Installing nmap

So useful and popular is nmap that it is now included in most Linux
distributions. Red Hat 7.0 and Debian 2.2, my two current flavors of
choice, both come with nmap (under Applications/System and Extra/Net,
respectively). Therefore, the easiest way for most Linux users to
install nmap is via their system's package-manager (e.g., RPM,
dselect, YAST) and preferred OS installation-medium (CD-ROM, FTP,
etc.).

If, however, you want the very latest version of nmap and/or its
source code, both are available from http://www.insecure.org/
(Fyodor's web site) in RPM and TGZ formats. Should you wish to compile
nmap from source, simply download and expand the tarball, then enter
these commands (allowing for any difference in the expanded source
code's directory-name; nmap v2.53 may be obsolete by the time you read
this):

                 cd nmap-2.53
                 ./configure
                 make
                 make install

                 Using nmap

There are two different ways to run nmap. The most powerful and
flexible way is via the command prompt. There is also a GUI called
nmapfe, which constructs and executes an nmap for you (see Figure 1).

                                                                        

                                     Figure 1. Sample nmapfe Session

This GUI is useful for quick-and-dirty scans or as an aid to learning
nmap's command-line syntax. However, I strongly recommend learning
nmap proper since the GUI presents only a subset of nmap's
features. Besides, it's overkill to fire up X for little old nmap.

The nmap commands are easy to learn. The basic syntax for simple scans
is: nmap -s (scan-type) -p (port-range options) (target). The -s flag
is immediately followed by one of the following:

                     T: TCP Connect Scan 
                     S: TCP SYN Scan 
                     F: TCP FIN Scan 
                     N: TCP NULL Scan 
                     X: TCP Xmas Tree Scan 
                     U: UDP Scan (can be combined with above) 
                     R: RPC Scan (can be combined with above) 

The -s flag, which specifies which type or types of scan to run, can
be followed by any of the TCP scan-types, U for UDP scanning, R for
RPC scanning/identification or any combination of these three groups
of flags. Only one TCP scan-type may be specified in a given session,
however. If the -s flag is omitted altogether, the default scan-type
is TCP Connect.

For example, -sSUR tells nmap to perform a SYN scan, a UDP scan and
finally an RPC scan/identification on the specified target(s). -sTSR
would fail, however, since TCP Connect and TCP SYN are both TCP scans.

If you state a port range using the -p flag, you can combine commas
and dashes to create a very specific group of ports to be scanned. For
example, typing -p 20-23,80,53,600-1024 tells nmap to scan the ports
20 through 23, 80, 53 and 600-1024. Don't use any spaces in your port
range, however.

Similarly, the ``target'' expression can be a hostname, a host IP
address, a network IP address or a range of IP addresses. For example
typing 192.168.17.* expands to all 255 IP addresses in the
network--192.168.17.0/24 (in fact, you could use 192.168.17. 0/24
instead); 10.13.[1,2,4].* expands to 10.13.1.0/24, 10.13.2.0/24, and
10.13.4.0/24. As you can see, nmap is very flexible in the types of
target expressions it can understand.

                 Reality Check I: Some Simple Sample Scans

Before we go any further, let's examine some basic scans that use the
flags we've discussed so far. The examples in this section all use
nmap version 2.53 (the most current as of this writing) running on Red
Hat 7.0. The target system in these examples is running Windows98 with
Sambar web server installed and active for good measure.

First, suppose we want nmap to perform an ``all-default'' scan. We're
not required to provide any flags if we don't want to; given nothing
more than a target IP or IP expression, nmap will ping each target
host and then scan it using the TCP Connect method on (destination)
ports 0-1024 plus all other ports listed in
/usr/share/nmap/nmap-services (your path to this file may vary), for a
total of 1,523 TCP ports. Listing 1 shows what such an all-default
scan looks like when run against a Windows98 system.

                 Listing 1. An ``All-Defaults'' nmap Scan 

Note that it took only two seconds to query 1,523 ports. When I said
the TCP Connect method is fast, I wasn't just whistling ``Dixie''.

For our next example scan, suppose we want to add UDP to the mix, and
while we're at it, we want to see if any of the open ports we find are
running RPC applications. Since we want to do UDP port scanning in
addition to, and not instead of, TCP Connect scanning, we'll need to
say so explicitly. Our command and its input will look like Listing 2.

                 Listing 2. Nmap Scan Using TCP Connect, UDP and RPC Modes 

The -sU and -sR scans (combined above in -sTUR) go particularly well
together: RPC is a UDP-intensive protocol. When nmap finds an RPC
service on an open port, it appends the RPC application's name in
parentheses, including the version number if nmap can make a credible
guess at one.

Suppose we're looking for something a bit more specific. This could be
because we have some idea of what the host is running and/or we wish
to minimize the scan time. To specify which ports we want to see, we
append the -p flag along with a list of ports. Commas and dashes, but
not white space, may be used in this list. Listing 3 shows a scan in
which we check all privileged ports (1-1024) plus a few high ports
we're worried about, namely TCP 12345 and 12346 (NetBus' default
ports) and UDP 31337 (BackOrifice's default):

                 Listing 3. Scanning for TCP and UDP on Selected Ports 

Finally, because it's so easy, let's do a scan on multiple hosts. The
host expression nmap accepts is even more flexible than the port
expression: wild cards, square brackets (lists) and
``slash/subnet-bits'' notation may be used. Here's what the command
would look like to perform the scan in Listing 3 on my entire test
network (254 addresses, output omitted this time):

                 nmap -sTU -p 1-1024,12345,12346,31336 10.13.13.0/24

                 Intermediate nmap

nmap sports a frightening array of features designed to sneak through
firewalls, avoid triggering intrusion-detection software and otherwise
help the user evade detection. I feel no urge whatsoever to discuss
those features here; while no doubt they have legitimate uses, I'd
like to spend the remainder of this article on a few nifty features
that are less obviously cracker-oriented.

Suppose you're the administrator of a large network and someone
installs a server in your machine room that appears to be reachable
from the Internet, in possible violation of your organization's
security policy (and/or to your indignation since you weren't asked
for permission). Before going on an authority-asserting rampage, you
decide to first find out as much as you can about the possible risks
to which your network has been exposed.

Luckily, the mystery server has an IP address scrawled on its front in
purple crayon. Equally luckily, you're a righteous nmap angel of
vengeance because you read ``Paranoid Penguin'' this month. Here are
some nmap options to help you find out just what's going on.

First, what OS is this beast running? OS fingerprinting, summoned by
the -O flag, may tell you. When you use -O, nmap sends packets with
various TCP options set and compares the replies it receives with its
OS fingerprinting database (/usr/share/nmap/nmap-os-fingerprints on my
Red Hat 7.0 system). In my experience this feature works extremely
well, except on MacOS 8 (which seems to stump it).

Next, are any of the active ports running services with root
privileges? Obviously some services need this much privilege but many
don't; if the web server on this box is running as root, someone is
going to need talking to for sure. Use the -I flag to have nmap query
the target's ident d�mon, whose sole purpose is to tell the world
which user owns each listening service.

Can we minimize the chances an overly aggressive scan will overload
the target system or the network? Oh yes. The -T flag allows us to
specify a timing mode; the options are Paranoid, Sneaky, Polite,
Normal, Aggressive and Insane, in increasing degree of
network-unfriendliness (based on how long nmap waits between packets
and whether it sends packets serially or in batches). -T Polite is a
good choice if you want to go easy on your target and/or network.

How do we do a fast scan that checks for likely services without
scanning all privileged ports?  The -F flag tells nmap to scan only
those ports listed in nmap-services. In this way, we avoid ports
unlikely to yield anything interesting.

Finally, is there an easy way to save our evidence of lameness as a
text file? Typing -oN filename tells nmap to write its results to a
text file. If we want nmap to use HaX0r Sp3ll1ng, we can use -oS
filename instead (``S'' is for ``Script-Kiddie-Talk'').

In Listing 4 we see the unauthorized server is accepting connections
for, among other things, Secure Shell, Telnet, HTTP/SSL, LPD, X and
nessus. nessus? Why, that's a security scanner.  You definitely don't
want internet hosts able to reach a nessus server on your
network--that just happens to be the topic of next month's column.

                 Listing 4. Using Some Intermediate Features 

As powerful as nmap is, nessus gives us a means of going a step
further and probing all these listening-ports nmap has found for known
weaknesses. Again, we'll focus on using these powerful tools for good
rather than evil; in the meantime, I hope you'll do the same with
nmap.
