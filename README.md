# insecure.org_txts

I accidentally found a bunch of old txt files when looking for insecure.org's maling list links. They range in age from the mid 80s to the late 90s and cover a range of topics. I make no claim to the ownership of these files, content contained therein, or the usage of them. They are here purely for me to read at my own leisure and as an unofficial off-site backup in case anything ever happens to the internet. Hey, it could happen.
